I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what
You've done in your life.
Baby I'll always be here by
your side
Don't leave me waiting too long,
Please come by!
I, I, I, I still believe in
your eyes
There is no choice,
I belong to your life.
Because I, I need you love you
some day
You'll be my baby
And will fly your way
And i'll fly with you,
I'll fly with you,
I'll fly with you!!!
Every day and every night,
I always dream that
You are by my side.
Oh, baby, every day and every
night,
Will I celebrate
It's born to be your life!
And I'll fly with you,
I'll fly with you,
I'll fly with you!!!
